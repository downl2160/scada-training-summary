# 📝 Module Notes – Ignition 8.1 Credential (Inductive University)

These are brief personal notes summarizing key topics covered during my training on the Ignition SCADA platform.

## ✅ Gateway and Installation

- Learned how to install Ignition on Windows.
- Explored the Gateway interface: status, modules, logs.
- Configured modules and connected to a trial OPC-UA device.

## 🔌 OPC-UA and Device Connection

- Enabled OPC-UA Server in Gateway.
- Connected a simulated device (e.g., generic modbus device).
- Viewed tags from the connected device in the Tag Browser.

## 🏷️ Tags and Tag Historian

- Created memory tags (e.g., MotorStatus, TankLevel).
- Configured scaling and engineering units.
- Enabled Tag Historian to log real-time and historical data.

## 🚨 Alarming

- Configured alarm conditions (e.g., High > 80, Critical > 95).
- Set up alarm pipelines (simple notification logic).
- Viewed and acknowledged alarms in runtime.

## 🎨 Vision and Perspective UI

- Created a basic HMI using Vision module.
- Dragged numeric displays, switches, and charts.
- Created a Perspective View (web-based UI).
- Linked components to tags using property bindings.

## 🔒 Security and Clients

- Configured user roles and security zones.
- Launched clients from browser and Designer.
- Controlled session access and login/logout.

## 🧠 Scripting and SQL Bindings (Basic)

- Used Expression Bindings for tag-based logic.
- Tried basic Python scripts for UI interactivity.
- Connected to a database and created queries.

> 🔧 These modules helped me understand how real-world SCADA systems are built using modular architecture, tags, alarms, and HMI screens. While it’s platform-specific (Ignition), the concepts directly apply to industrial SCADA environments.
